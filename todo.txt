sample usage:
jsonr -i "something: value1" -h "Authorization: Bearer XXX" -r 200 -t "Success" -c "./config" -e "test" -m POST -v sample.http|https://www.google.com

-i Provide value for [i]nput variables

ERROR: No value for @@something@@ provided! Use the -v "something: {value}" parameter.



-h Provide value for additional [h]eaders

-s Expected response [s]tatus code

-t Expected text that should be contained within response body

-c Configuration folder with json files (key:value objects) for holding variables values (it will be persisted, no need to repeat this param in future)

-e environment - name of the file from -c configuration folder (no .json extension required)

-m HTTP method

-v Verbose mode - more details in output (full request with headers) + response headers

-d Debug mode - provide all logs from jsonr (use it only if you have issues with application, you can send such logs to help troubleshooting)

-b request body (if not  willing to use http file)

--no-auto-json-header by default jsonr will append Content-Type "application/json" header to all requests
 (if such header won't be present in definition) so you don't need to repeat it. Use this option to disable
this behaviour

-o [o]utput file for response details (status code, total execution time, body, headers), if omitted outputs to stdout. 
Caution: If file exists it will overwrite it. If no extension provided, it will automatically append .json

EXAMPLE: jsonr ... -o my-response => saves to ./my-response.json, overwrites file if it already exists!

param:
  fileName in current working directory, or absolute path or uri of the resource
